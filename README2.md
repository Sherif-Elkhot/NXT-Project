# Shopping from E‑commerce

**Shopping from E‑commerce** is a web-based price comparison and shopping aggregator. It brings together products from major online stores (e.g., Amazon, Noon, Jumia) so users can search once, compare prices, shipping, availability, and buy at the **lowest total cost** (including delivery and discounts).

The goal is to save time and money by providing a unified search experience, transparent pricing breakdown, and smart suggestions across multiple trusted marketplaces.
